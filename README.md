## Introduction
The Cafe Application is designed to streamline the operations of a cafe, providing functionality for managing orders, inventory, and customer interactions. It consists of three major components:

1. **Backend Logic (Spring Boot)**: This component handles the server-side logic, including order processing, inventory management, user authentication, and more.
2. **Web Application (Next.js)**: The web interface allows cafe staff to take orders, manage inventory, and view customer information. Users can also interact with the cafe through the website.
3. **Android Application (Kotlin)**: The Android app enables mobile access to the cafe's functionality, allowing staff to process orders on the go, and customers to place orders and explore cafe options.
